Quotify
===========

A Google Chrome extension that allows you to right click on a textarea and force the contents to wrap at 80 characters and start with a quote character '>'. This might be useful for online services---such as Outlook online---that do no allow for formatting replies to email in such a way.

This is based on word-wrap, https://github.com/ghuntley/word-wrap .
